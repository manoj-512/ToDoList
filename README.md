## How it works
What It Can Do
Add Tasks: Type in your task and click the "Add Task" button to add it to the list.
Mark as Done: Check the box next to a task to mark it as completed. To make it clear, completed tasks are highlighted in green.
Delete Tasks: Click the delete button to remove tasks you no longer need.
Save Your List: The app remembers your tasks using local storage, so even if you refresh or close the page, your list will still be there.
Smart Display: The task container only shows up when there are tasks in the list and hides itself when the list is empty.
